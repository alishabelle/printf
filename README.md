# printf/0x10. C - printf


Overview: This project uses variadic functions and structs to replicate the printf function in C.


Project Files:

(1) _printf.c - the functions and array of structs in this file are used to match format strings to the correct print function to handle each specific data type

(2) _putchar.c - this function is used to write to the standard output

(3) holberton.h - this header file contains the necessary prototypes and definitions to implement the _printf function
